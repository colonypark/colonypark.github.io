				<h1>Neighborhood Beautification</h1>
				<p>After 40 years, our neighborhood is showing signs of it's age. From the condition of the front entrance, to the crumbling curbs and road surface. There are few features too, such as landscaping and park benches to improve appearances. The city's budget is needs-based and our roads are not the worst, according to the city, so that must wait for now. However, there is something we can do for ourselves to address the entrance signs and park.</p>

				<h2>The Back Story</h2>
				<p>My wife and I moved into Colony Park in 1995, 4 months after the birth of our first-born child, Lily. I can recall the brick entrance signs to the subdivision were lit up at night. Although I don't ever recall seeing flowers	 around those signs, the bushes were maintained. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and as one would expect, time and the elements have taken their toll.</p>

				<p>In 2013, I asked a city official about the signs to find out who owns them and why they weren't being maintained. I was told that at one time there was a Home Owners' Association, but since they were voted out years ago, maintaining the signs became the responsibility of the first two homeowners on Colony Park Drive (addresses 126 &amp; 185), whose property they are on. I also asked about getting park benches after the city cancelled plans to develop our park with playground equipment earlier that year. There are deed restrictions on Colony Park (the park), in part because of the high pressure gas lines running through it and partly because of the rights of those homeowners whose property abutts the park. Although the restrictions do say our park can include "... benches, picnic areas or tot lots."<sup>1</sup> I never did get a direct response on why we couldn't get a bench or two. I suppose city council quickly reallocated that money to other projects.</p>

				<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://nextdoor.com/invite/vagpggqsyxteztzvbups" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a> social network and the rise of Crowdfunding sites, I decided to start a grass-roots community project, in which some neighbors would pitch in with their time and effort, donate needed items and a few bucks, and we could make our subdivision a little nicer place to live. We don't need an HOA or the City to do that... We can do it ourselves.</p>

				<p>According to Nextdoor, there are 207 households in Colony Park. It looks like there are about 212 according to Pickerington's most recent <a href="http://www.ci.pickerington.oh.us/upload/content/files/Planning_and_Zoning/PickZone31114.pdf" target="_blank">zoning map</a> (published 3/11/14). At any rate, only about 25% of those households are on Nextdoor. I have no idea how many of those houses have internet access, but I'd put a conservative estimate at around 75%, if you include folks who just use a phone to access the internet. A campaign like this would need to have a broad enough reach to build awareness in the neighborhood. Hopefully, some of you reading this web page or the posts on Nextdoor will spread the word to neighbors too.</p>

				<h2>The Plan</h2>
				<p>The plan that I am putting forth is a modest one, that is intended to get a lot of benefit for very little up-front cost.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Removal of overgrown bushes.</li>
					<li>Prep and paint the sign letters.</li>
					<li>Create a flower bed for landscaping, including adding topsoil, landscaping fabric, and edging.</li>
					<li>Decide on plants that are appealing, low maintenance, and won't obstruct visibility of drivers exiting onto Long Rd.</li>
					<li>Planting and mulching.</li>
					<li>Installation of lights.</li>
				</ol>
				Pre-requisites:
				<ol>
					<li>Obtain permission to do beautification on the signs (these are on private property).</li>
					<li>Notify the City of Pickerington of intentions.</li>
					<li>Have underground utilities marked, prior to any digging.</li>
					<li>Call South Central Power and consult with an engineer.</li>
					<li>Raise funds &amp; build awareness!</li>
				</ol>
				Caveats:
				<ol>
					<li>The electricity to run the AC powered lights as before would have to be billed to a resident or association, so that is a challenge. The annual cost to power energy-efficient floodlights dusk-to-dawn will cost approximately $175-$200. We are considering a solar-powered option as an alternative, but they most-likely will be problematic as there isn't full sun there and accumlation of snow on solar panels will reduce light-gathering ability too.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Why Help?</h2>
				<p>Why am I asking for your help? Simply because it is the most effective way to get action. Every bit of effort, materials, and money contributed will be invested 100% toward efforts to beautify Colony Park. If we exceed the donation goal, we can get even more done the first year.</p>
