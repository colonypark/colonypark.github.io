                <h2>The Back Story</h2>
                <p>My wife and I moved into Colony Park in 1995, 4 months after the birth of our first-born child, Lily. I can recall the brick entrance signs to the subdivision were lit up at night. Although I don't ever recall seeing landscaping around those signs, the bushes were maintained. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and as one would expect, time and the elements have taken their toll.</p>

                <p>In 2013, I asked a city official about the signs to find out who owns them and why they aren't well maintained. I was told that at one time there was a Home Owners' Association, but since they were voted out years ago, maintaining the signs became the responsibility of the first 2 homeowners on Colony Park Drive (addresses 126 &amp; 185) - whose property they are. Thus, it was out of the hands of the city. I also asked about getting park benches after the city cancelled plans to develop the park with playground equipment earlier that year. There are deed restrictions on Colony Park, in part because of the high pressure gas lines running through it and partly because of the rights of those homeowners whose property abutts the park. Although the restrictions do say it can include "... benches, picnic areas or tot lots." I never did get a direct response on why we couldn't get a bench or two.</p>

                <p>With the introduction of the Nextdoor social network and the rise of Crowdfunding sites, I got the idea that maybe I could start a grass-roots community project, where we could get a some folks to pitch in with their time and effort, donate needed items and a few bucks, and we could make Colony Park a nicer place to live. We don't need an HOA or the City to do that... We can do it ourselves.</p>

                <p>According to NextDoor, there are 207 households in Colony Park. It looks like there are about 212 according to the 2012 Pickerington Zoning map. At any rate, only about 25% of those households are on Nextdoor. I have no idea how many of those houses have internet access, but I'd put a conservative estimate at around 75%, if you include folks who just use a phone to access the internet. A campaign like this would need to have a broad enough reach to build awareness in the neighborhood. Hopefully, some of you reading this web page or the posts on Nextdoor will spread the word to neighbors too.</p>
