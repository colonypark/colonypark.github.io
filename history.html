        <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Colony Park was established circa 1975 by William Fannin Builders. That was a long time ago... The Vietnam war ended. Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft made the first ever US-Soviet link-up in space.  The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl and the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.</p>

        <h1>Early Pickerington Ties</h1>
        <h2>Tile Mill</h2>
        <p>In 1882, Joseph Ebright and Jacob Harmon purchased from W.G. Beals a 1.96-acre tract at the northwest corner of Pickerington, east of State Route 256 (Hill Road North), between the corporation line and railroad, and soon thereafter built thereon a tile manufacturing plant.  In 1884, an adjoining one-acre tract was purchased from the Zeigler addition from which glacial clay was taken for drain tile manufacture.  In the early 1900s, clay was obtained on the north side of Long Road at the "Y" intersection of Long Road and Columbus Street, west of downtown Pickerington.</p>

        <p>In May 1885, the Ebright and Harmon partnership was dissolved and the business was continued by Adam Langle and Jacob Harmon. The drying shed burned and after being rebuilt was sold to Adam Langle and William E. Fenstermaker.</p>

        <p>By 1911, Frank R. Fenstermaker was a partner in the firm of W. E. Fenstermaker and Son, manufacturers of drain tile and dealers in cement, coal and lime, which operated until about 1930 when the business was discontinued.  A few years later the drying shed was torn down.  The remains of the kiln and smokestack are still in place.  The clay pit served as the village "dump" for many years, but is now completely filled and covered with soil.</p>

        <p>During the 1900s a facility for loading and unloading livestock was in operation just east of the tile mill.  The stockyard was probably built by the railroad company and managed by the station agent. Th years during which it was in use are not known.</p>
