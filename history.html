          <h1>Early Pickerington Years</h1>
          <h2>Tile Mill part I</h2>
          <p>In 1882, Joseph Ebright and Jacob Harmon purchased from W.G. Beals a 1.96-acre tract at the northwest corner of Pickerington, east of State Route 256 (Hill Road North), between the corporation line and railroad, and soon thereafter built thereon a tile manufacturing plant.  In 1884, an adjoining one-acre tract was purchased from the Zeigler addition from which glacial clay was taken for drain tile manufacture.  In the early 1900s, clay was obtained on the north side of Long Road at the "Y" intersection of Long Road and Columbus Street, west of downtown Pickerington.</p>

          <p>In May 1885, the Ebright and Harmon partnership was dissolved and the business was continued by Adam Langle and Jacob Harmon. The drying shed burned and after being rebuilt was sold to Adam Langle and William E. Fenstermaker.</p>

          <p>By 1911, Frank R. Fenstermaker was a partner in the firm of W. E. Fenstermaker and Son, manufacturers of drain tile and dealers in cement, coal and lime, which operated until about 1930 when the business was discontinued.  A few years later the drying shed was torn down.  The remains of the kiln and smokestack are still in place.  The clay pit served as the village "dump" for many years, but is now completely filled and covered with soil.</p>

          <p>During the 1900s a facility for loading and unloading livestock was in operation just east of the tile mill.  The stockyard was probably built by the railroad company and managed by the station agent. The years during which it was in use are not known.</p>

          <p><strong>Then:</strong> The Pickerington Tile Mill was constructed circa 1882 on the east side of Hill Road North (state Route 256) near the railroad tracks in Pickerington. The east end of the mill's 3acre tract contained a glacial clay deposit, which the mill owners used to manufacture drain tile and brick. Later, clay was dug and hauled to the mill by horse and wagon from an area that is now Colony Park subdivision. W. E. Fenstermaker (at far right in photo) was the owner of the flourishing operation when this photo was taken of tile mill employees in the early 1900s. At the time, the mill sold coal, lime, cement and Bradly's Fertilizers in addition to brick and tile. In 1911, Fenstermaker's son, Frank, became his partner. At the height of their business in 1921 and 1922, three kilns were in operation. However, business dwindled during the Great Depression. The tile mill discontinued operations in 1931 and the large tile shed was dismantled.</p>
          <p><strong>Now:</strong> Today, all that remains of the tile mill is one of its “stacks” (chimney) which can be seen off state Route 256 near the north entrance to Olde Pickerington Village on property still owned by Fenstermaker heirs, the Spears family.</p>

          <h2>1911 Airplane Landing</h2>
          <p>In 1911, in what is now Meadowbrook Estates (the subdivision behind the Circle K), a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Airplanes/Model_B.htm">Wright Model B</a> airplane made an emergency landing one Sunday. Recall that the very first airplane, the Wright Flyer, first flew in 1903, so most people had never seen an airplane with their own eyes - in fact the first airplane ever was seen flying over Columbus skies the previous year. Imagine the experience of residents looking up in the sky from their daily work, or coming home from church and seeing an airplane coming in to land in a field!</p>

          <p>There is a high probability that the pilot of the aircraft was Philip Parmalee, a govenment air scout. Philip participated in the first international aviataion meet of 1911 in Columbus along with 3 other pilots and aircraft! The event was held from May 29 to June 4. Admission was $1 adults / 25&cent; kids</p>
